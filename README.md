# Target-Marketing
A national veteranâ€™s organization wishes to develop a data mining model to improve the costeffectiveness of their direct marketing campaign. The organization, with its in-house database of over 13 million donors, is one of the largest direct mail fundraisers in the United States. According to their recent mailing records, the overall response rate is 5.1%. Out of those who responded (donated), the average donation is $13.00. Each mailing, which includes a gift of personalized address labels and assortments of cards and envelopes, costs $0.68 to produce and send. <br>
<b> To do: </b>
To develop a classification model that can effectively capture donors so that the expected net profit is maximized. Weighted sampling is used, under-representing the non-responders so that the sample has a more balanced numbers of donors and non-donors.


Conducted: <br>
1. Exploratory data analysis<br>
2. Data cleaning, Data reduction<br>
3. Developed some classification models to predict donors (TARGET_B). <br>
4. Examine the performance of support vector machines for classifying donors.<br>
5. Performance evaluated based on costs and benefits; A model that maximizes profit.<br>
6. Develop a model to predict donation amount (TARGET_D) directly, and examine how to combine the response and donation amount models to identify the most profitable individuals to target. <br>
