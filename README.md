# Target-Marketing
A national veteranâ€™s organization wishes to develop a data mining model to improve the costeffectiveness of their direct marketing campaign. The organization, with its in-house database of over 13 million donors, is one of the largest direct mail fundraisers in the United States. According to their recent mailing records, the overall response rate is 5.1%. Out of those who responded (donated), the average donation is $13.00. Each mailing, which includes a gift of personalized address labels and assortments of cards and envelopes, costs $0.68 to produce and send. Using these facts, we take a sample of this dataset to develop a classification model that can effectively capture donors so that the expected net profit is maximized. Weighted sampling is used, under-representing the non-responders so that the sample has a more balanced numbers of donors and non-donors.
